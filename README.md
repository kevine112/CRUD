# CRUD
Here i create a simple CRUD service that can be, 
CREATE ( POST METHOD ) , 

READ ( GET METHOD ) ,

UPDATE ( PATCH METHOD ) ,

DELETE ( DELETE METHOD ),

DATABASE ( mysqls ),

restAPI,


in my code i do use mysql as database and the important file you can see in ( .env.example )
this is my first day touching express js or backend with javascript, so i hope yall understand with my structure code.
so i think i complete all challange from my bootcamp, because all their require i create it there.
